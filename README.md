# VirtMon
Rudimentary Electron application that acts as a virtual monitor for viewing the display of a USB capture card

## Reasoning
Sometime between 2020 and 2021, I needed a way view the display of 2 Etherium mining computers. It didn't need to view them constantly, so purchasing 2 monitors seemed as a waste of money. Purchasing as traditional portable monitor was also fairly expensive at the time. Instead, I wrote this application to achieve a similar effect as a portable monitor with the laptop I already owned

## Required Hardware
- Any Computer (Laptop for portability)
- USB Capture Card (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QF6YWWD?psc=1 What I used)

## Usage
1. Clone the repo and make sure to have NodeJS installed
2. Build the application with the supplied build command, or run from the development enviroment
3. Connect the USB Capture Card to the host machine, then connect an HDMI cable from the Capture Card to the other machine
4. After running, press LALT to access the sourcess list and select the Capture Card
